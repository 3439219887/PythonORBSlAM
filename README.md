# PythonORBSlAM
--------------------
A Beginner's Python project that implemented certain parts of ORBSLAM

# What I did:
I started this project in 2020 winter break.

This is more or less a project where I learned things and realized that I actually can implement the minimum working part of it(because most of the methods used was already encapsulated in either OpenCV or sk-image), rather than a project where I actually implemented a new thing or a big thing. I restructure the codes for adding on features laters. 

I implemented and compared different feature extraction methods: Corners(CV2.GoodFeaturesToTrack), ORB(ORB.detect), evenCorners(divided each frame to 9 windows and perform Corners on each) and evenORB. The last two was inspired by the Q-tree algorithm, aiming to make the feature points spread more evenly in the picture. (And of course at the end the evenCorners prevail)

I used open3d for visualization so that I can get a pointcloud file output. But the visualization doesn't seem to be working well. 

I did make functional changes to Yang's project, his project assumed that the camera will travel forward mostly linear(he implemented his own extract_RT method), while I utilized the OpenCV's function. I also added a clache augmentation option for better performance in low-light scenario. Besides, his implementaion utilizes multi-threading, I adapted that because I found that Open3d had problems with threadings(it will interrupt the video-processing thread for some reason). 

# TO-DO:
Improve Visualization(points cloud downsampling, camera position when running, etc.)

Improve the algorithm(Filters, Qtree, g2o, etc.)

Visual BoW for Loop detection

# Dependency

OpenCV

sk-image

Open3d

NumPy
